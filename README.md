# Traffic Sign Detection Using YOLOv8

![Traffic Sign Detection](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400)

In this project, I trained a YOLOv8 model to detect various traffic signs from images. Traffic sign detection is crucial for autonomous driving systems, and YOLOv8's ability to perform real-time detection makes it an excellent choice for this task.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision):** 76.8%
- **Precision:** 78.9%
- **Recall:** 67.3%

These metrics reflect the model's effectiveness in detecting traffic signs, with a precision of 78.9%, indicating that out of all the positive predictions made by the model, 78.9% were correct. The recall of 67.3% shows that the model detected 67.3% of all actual positive instances.

## Model Architecture
The YOLOv8 model was selected for its high-speed detection and strong performance on small object detection, which is crucial for recognizing traffic signs. The model was fine-tuned on a specialized dataset containing various traffic sign categories.

## Training Process
The model was trained on a dataset featuring diverse traffic sign images captured under various lighting and weather conditions. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, scaling, and rotation were used to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. The training process was closely monitored, ensuring the model remained well-balanced between precision and recall.

## Results
The YOLOv8 model achieved a commendable mAP of 76.8%, making it highly effective for real-world traffic sign detection. The results indicate the model's robustness in detecting a wide range of traffic signs under different scenarios, making it a valuable component for autonomous driving systems.
